Red_wine_quality_prediction
Hello everyone, I'm Vaibhav Gupta. I've developed a project focused on predicting wine quality, which involves categorical data with 7 different categories ranging from 1 (best) to 7 (worst). 
To achieve this, I utilized a Random Forest Classifier and conducted Hyperparameter Tuning to attain the best possible results.
